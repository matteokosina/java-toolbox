<b>Please follow these guidelines strictly, to ensure consistency and clarity across the repository.</b>

## How to Contribute?

## Code Contribution

<b>All contributions should be made to the class - toolbox.class.</b>

You are allowed to add any Java method that can be potentially useful in the exam. All the methods have to be static.

For every method contributed, you need to:
- Ensure the method works and does its intended job.
- Document the method to include `@return`, `@parameter` and description of what the method does.


Here is an example:

```java
/**
* This Method describes what it does.
* 
* @param  paramName  description of the parameter
* @return            description of the return value
*/
public static returnType methodName(paramType paramName) {
    //method body
}
```

## Building the Project

Ensure that you test your contributions before submitting a pull request. Here's how:

1. Compile the class you contributed using `javac ClassName.java`.
2. Run the class using `java ClassName`.
